# Genomic-Tools

Helpful bioinformatics/genomics tools for future me to use (and maybe someone else too).

- **Parse_GFF_GTF**  
  R Notebook to read, clean, and extract metadata fields (like gene names and transcript IDs) from GFF/GTF files.


- **FASTA_Quick_Stats**
  
R Notebook to quickly summarize the contents of a FASTA file â€” number of sequences, total genome length, GC content, and proportion of ambiguous bases (N's).
